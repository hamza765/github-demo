Demonstrating how to create new repositories

## And showing the vim editor
Once upon a midnight dreary,
While I pondered, weak, and weary,
Over a quaint and curious a volume of forgotten lore.

As I nodded, nearly napping, 
suddenly, there came a tapping,
as though someone, gently rapping, rapping upon my chamber door. 
'Tis some visitor I muttered, this it is, and nothing more.

Ah, yes I remember, it twas in the bleak december,
as each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
